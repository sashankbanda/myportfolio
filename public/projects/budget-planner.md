### Description

This project is a **full-stack budget planner application** designed to help users manage their personal finances. It features a secure, multi-user system where individuals can sign up, log in, and track their income and expenses.

The backend, built with FastAPI, provides a robust API for handling user authentication, transaction management (CRUD operations), and complex financial statistics. It processes data to calculate monthly summaries, category-wise breakdowns, and spending trends over time.

The frontend is a dynamic and visually engaging single-page application built with React. It features a comprehensive dashboard with interactive charts and graphs to visualize financial data, stat cards for a quick overview, and a detailed transaction history with advanced filtering and search capabilities. The user interface has a modern, cyberpunk-inspired "glassmorphism" theme.

* **Centralized Financial Overview:** Key metrics like total income, total expenses, and current balance are prominently displayed on "stat cards," providing an immediate snapshot of the user's financial status for the current month.
