  "about": {
    "intro": "I'm a developer who builds apps that solve everyday problems. I focus on making them work well and also look good.",
    "expertise": "Full-Stack Development: I build websites and apps from start to finish. I work on all the parts, from the design users see to the server and database behind it. My main tools are JavaScript (React, Express.js, Node.js), but I also have experience with Python and Spring Boot.\n\nAI & Automation Tools: I love making apps smarter and more helpful. I’ve built tools that can answer questions from a PDF, change audio files into text, and automatically upload videos to YouTube.\n\nDatabases & Version Control: I use both SQL (like MySQL) and NoSQL (like MongoDB) for databases. For all my projects, I use Git and GitHub to keep my code organized.\n\nCreative Skills: Besides coding, I also do graphic design and video editing. These skills help me make sure the final app is easy to use and looks great."  },
